# JiraIssueXMLExportToCSV
This project provides an easy and free way to export all the fields that Jira Export cannot do in CSV format on its own. 

To use this, export XML the Jira issues you want.

Then download these files and run the ConvertJiraXMLtoCSV.cmd file
  it's one line, it runs the powershell script in STA mode, if you have PowerShell 3.0 you don't need to use this cmd file

A window will open, select the XML file of your Jira Issues

Another window will open, choose a file name or overwrite an existing CSV file



This is still a work in progress.
